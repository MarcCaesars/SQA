Pre-Condition: 
'Dictionary Management System'(short as 'Dic' afer) is a system designed and developed by me during my  internship. 
Basically, it's B/S model web appliction, and build on SSH framework. It is developed to manage the segememt dictionary file.
This QA document will be based on the Dic.

QA:
As we know, the quality of a software system is very significant to a application, so it's important for developers to make 
the QA plan well before deploy or publish the application.
